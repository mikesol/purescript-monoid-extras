-- $mlist
--
-- The idea of /heterogeneous lists/ has been around for a long time.
-- Here, we adopt heterogeneous lists where the element types are all
-- monoids: this allows us to leave out identity values, so that a
-- heterogeneous list containing only a single non-identity value can
-- be created without incurring constraints due to all the other
-- types, by leaving all the other values out.

-- MList -----------------------------------

-- | Type class for heterogeneous monoidal lists, with a single method
--   allowing construction of an empty list.
class MList l where
  -- | The /empty/ heterogeneous list of type @l@. Of course, @empty
  -- == 'mempty'@, but unlike 'mempty', @empty@ does not require
  -- 'Monoid' constraints on all the elements of @l@.
  empty   :: l

  empty     = unit

instance MList l => MList (a ::: l) where
  empty   = (Nothing /\ empty)

-- Embedding -------------------------------------------

-- | The relation @l Includes a@ holds when @a@ is the type of an element
--   in @l@.  For example,  @(Char ::: Int ::: Bool ::: Nil) Includes Int@.
class Includes l a where
  -- | Inject a value into an otherwise empty heterogeneous list.
  inj  :: a -> l

  -- | Get the value of type @a@ from a heterogeneous list, if there
  --   is one.
  get  :: l -> Maybe a

  -- | Alter the value of type @a@ by applying the given function to it.

-- Monoid actions -----------------------------------------

-- $mlist-actions
-- Monoidal heterogeneous lists may act on one another as you would
-- expect, with each element in the first list acting on each in the
-- second.  Unfortunately, coding this up in type class instances is a
-- bit fiddly.

-- | @SM@, an abbreviation for \"single monoid\" (as opposed to a
--   heterogeneous list of monoids), is only used internally to help
--   guide instance selection when defining the action of
--   heterogeneous monoidal lists on each other.
